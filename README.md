## Project Overview

Pseudo-Instagram is a sophisticated social media application project that encompasses various features aimed at delivering a rich user experience. Some of the core objectives include:

- **Authentication System**: Users can authenticate using their passwords, with provisions for additional security measures like two-factor authentication (2FA).

- **User Profiles**: Users have comprehensive profiles containing essential information such as Nickname, Age, Biography, Email, and Phone Number. Profile Picture is optional. Users must verify their registered email to access the application, adding an extra layer of security.

- **Connections and Interactions**: Users can follow and unfollow each other. The project supports blocking functionality, where blocked users are restricted from accessing profile details of the user who blocked them.

- **Media Sharing**: Users can post various types of media files, including Photos, Videos, and GIFs, accompanied by captions. Optional tagging of other users in posts is available as a bonus feature.

- **Engagement**: Users can interact with posted media, liking and commenting on them. Comment replies, while not mandatory, offer a bonus scoring opportunity.

- **Private Messaging**: The project includes a direct messaging feature that enables users to engage in one-to-one private conversations.

The project encourages collaboration by accommodating teams of up to three members. It requires interaction with a database backend server for data storage and retrieval. Additionally, the project provides options for web-based frontend development, and while UI implementation is not mandatory, it can contribute to project grades.
